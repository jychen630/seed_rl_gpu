todo

1. all settings (bipolar, parallel chains, cartpole)
2. measurement: execution time per agent, throughput (agent/sec), memory usage, gpu usage (for jax and pytorch)
3. execution time per agent is a function of K for each setting 
4. accelerator: pure numpy, jax, pytorch, 
5. fix: how many agent? 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000

step 1: execution time per agent is a function of K (i.e \#of agent)
step 1: automatically get 2 measurements. (save structured data)
step 2: accelerator: jax (achieve same result)
step 3: accelerator: pytorch (achieve same result)
